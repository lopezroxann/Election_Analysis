## Election Audit Summary
In summary, there are a couple ways that the commission could use our code for any election. This code can be used to look at a breakdown of their demographics per county. They can view which age group appeals to each candidate as well as race, ethnicity, gender, income and education. This information could help for future elections to help each candidate market towards their target audience.
